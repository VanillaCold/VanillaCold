<h3>Hey there! I'm Vanilla, </h3>
<p>a Spore modding enthusiast and aspiring game developer.  
If you've heard of me before, then it's likely through a community connected to the 2008 video game Spore.  </p>

I've spent a <b>lot</b> of time modding Spore, from early meddling back in 2017 to more complicated data-driven systems such as <a href="https://github.com/VanillaCold/Spore-CustomAssetTypes">custom asset types</a>.  

If you're interested in seeing demonstations of my Spore mods, I'd recommend checking my Youtube channel out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vanillacoldspore">here.</a>
